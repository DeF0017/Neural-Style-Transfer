# Neural-Style-Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a fascinating deep learning project that combines artistic style with the content of an image.This repository contains an implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST) â€“ a deep learning technique that merges the artistic style of one image with the content of another image, resulting in visually appealing artistic images.

# Requirements
* Python
* TensorFlow 
* NumPy
* OpenCV (for image manipulation)
* Pre-trained VGG-19 model network (or similar)

# Installation and Usagse
* Cloning the repository:
  ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/DeF0017/Neural-Style-Transfer.git
__OR__
* Open the python notebook in google colab.
* Import the content image and style image in google colab.
* Run the code.

# Acknowledgement
* Special thanks to Gatys et al.'s seminal paper on Neural Style Transfer.
